                     from Export files
                     
  fileN              File name (absolute or relative path) to import to. Can
                     specify multiple files.
                     Files must follow the naming convention:
                     objectName.type.txt
                     If specify files, response file is not allowed. If there
                     isn't objectName neither @responsefil, objectnames will
                     be readed from stdin.
                     
  @responsefile      When import, file containing list of files to import to.
                                  Each line: [-options] filePath
                     When export, file containing list of access object.
                                  Each line: AccessObject
                     names to export to.
                     For each file to import, you can specify options 
                     applicable for the corresponding object type. See Options
                     section above 
                     If specified, list of files / objectnames are not allowed
                     
  exportFolder       Folder where write the Access objects to. If the folder
                     do not exist, asvn creates it.

  objectnameN        List of object to export to. Objects listed must follow
                     the naming convention: type.objectName. You can use 
					 wildcards. So:
					  - frm.* will export all the forms
					  - *.*   will export all the objects. 
					  - *.C*  will export all the objects that begins with C
					 If there isn't objectName neither @responsefile, 
					 objectnames will be readed from stdin

Files and objects with spaces must be quoted. For example: "frm.Order Details"
